### 3. Create a GitHub Codespace

**We are setup [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for you, so you don't need to install anything**.

The remote environment is based on a Docker image that contains the next tools:

- Git 2.40.0
- Java 17.0.6
- Maven 3.9.1
- Node 18.15.0
- NPM 9.5.0

Once the fork is created you will have a copy of the repository. **Create a GitHub Codespace to start working on it**.

You can create a GitHub Codespace from the web interface: `Code` -> `Codespaces` --> `New with options`.
